<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shrek</h3>

<p>Ok. These might all be kid's movies. I have never outgrown a good kid's movie. I bust a gut every time I watch Shrek and absolutely love the music scene at the end.</p>

<h3>Up!</h3>

<p>Really good. I haven't seen it in a while so it might be time.</p>

<h3>Star Wars: A New Hope</h3>

<p>I'm more a Star Trek fan than Star Wars, but the Trek movies are not that great. Only the series. And I saw A New Hope when it came out. Amazing for it's time.</p>
